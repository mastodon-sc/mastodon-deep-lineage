## Lineage Tree Classification

* This plugin is capable of grouping similar lineage trees together.
* The similarity of a pair of lineage trees is computed based on the Zhang edit distance for unordered
  trees ([Zhang, K. Algorithmica 15, 205â€“222, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01975866)). This method captures the cost
  of the transformation of one tree into the other.
* The cost function applied for the tree edit distance uses the attribute branch spot duration, which is computed as a
  difference of time points between to subsequent divisions reflecting the start and the end of a spot's lifetime.
* Thus, the linage classification operates on Mastodon's branch graph.
* Illustration of allowed
  transformations: ![tree_edit_distance.png](doc/deep_lineage/lineage_classification/tree_edit_distance.png)
* A basic example of the tree edit
  distance: ![tree_edit_distance_example.png](doc/deep_lineage/lineage_classification/tree_edit_distance_example.png)
* The similarity is computed between all possible combinations of lineage trees leading to a two-dimensional similarity
  matrix. This matrix is then used to perform
  an [agglomerative hierarchical clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering) into a specifiable
  number of classes.

### Parameters:

* Crop criterion:
  * Time point (default)
  * Number of spots
* Crop start
* Crop end
* Number of classes (minimum 2)
* Minimum number of divisions
* Similarity measure:
  * Normalized Zhang Tree Edit Distance (default). $\frac{distance_{treeA,treeB}}{distance_{treeA,emptyTree} + distance_
    {treeB,emptyTree}}$
  * Per Branch Spot Zhang Tree Edit Distance. $\frac{distance_{treeA,treeB}}{numBranchSpotsA + numBranchSpotsB}$
  * Zhang Tree Edit Distance as described in ([Zhang](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01975866)).
* Linkage strategy for hierarchical clustering,
  cf. [linkage methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Cluster_Linkage)
  * Average (default)
  * Single
  * Complete
* Feature:
  * Branch duration (default and currently only selectable feature)
* Show dendrogram of clustering

### Example:

* Demo data: [Example data set](doc/deep_lineage/lineage_classification/lineage_classification.mastodon)
  * The demo data does not contain any image data.
  * The spatial positions of the spots are randomly generated.
  * When opening the dataset, you should confirm that you open the project with dummy
    images. ![Dummy images](doc/deep_lineage/lineage_classification/dummy.png)
* The track scheme of the demo data containing 8 lineage tree in total. You may see that the "symmetric", the "
  asymmetric" and the "single division" trees look
  similar to each other, but dissimilar to the other
  trees. ![Trackscheme](doc/deep_lineage/lineage_classification/trackscheme.png)
* The lineage classification dialog. ![Settings](doc/deep_lineage/lineage_classification/settings.png)
* The resulting dendrogram. ![Dendrogram](doc/deep_lineage/lineage_classification/dendrogram.png)
* The resulting tag set used for coloring the track
  scheme. ![Trackscheme with tags](doc/deep_lineage/lineage_classification/trackscheme_with_tags.png)
* The resulting tag set used for coloring the track scheme branch
  view. ![Trackscheme Branch View with tags](doc/deep_lineage/lineage_classification/trackscheme_branch_with_tags.png)

## Label image exporter

* The Label image exporter is capable of saving a label image to a file using the existing ellipsoids in Mastodon.
* For the labels, the _spot ids_, _branch spot ids_ or the _track ids_ that correspond to the spots / ellipsoids may be
  used. Since these Ids are counted zero based in Mastodon, an **offset of 1** is added to all Ids so that no label
  clashes with the background of zero.
* The recommended export format is '*.tif'-files. However, it should work also for other formats supported by ImageJ.
* The export uses an image with signed integer value space, thus the maximum allowed id is 2.147.483.646.
* Exporter can be found here:  ![Plugin Export Menu](doc/deep_lineage/export_label_image/plugin_export_menu.png)
* The dialog:  ![Plugin Export Dialog](doc/deep_lineage/export_label_image/plugin_export_dialog.png)
  * Label Id: The id that is used for the labels. The default is the Spot track Id.
    * The ids correspond to the highlighted columns in the feature
      table: ![Feature Table](doc/deep_lineage/export_label_image/plugin_export_table.png)
  * Frame rate reduction: Only export every n-th frame. 1 means no reduction. Value must be >= 1.
    * The frame number corresponds to the _Spot frame_ column in the feature table.
  * Save to: Path to the file to save the label image to.
